## [v5.1.2](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.1...v5.1.2) - 2024-10-16 

This is a hotfix release with one change. 

Prysm v5.1.1 contains an updated implementation of the beacon api streaming events endpoint. This
new implementation contains a bug that can cause a panic in certain conditions. The issue is
difficult to reproduce reliably and we are still trying to determine the root cause, but in the
meantime we are issuing a patch that recovers from the panic to prevent the node from crashing.

This only impacts the v5.1.1 release beacon api event stream endpoints. This endpoint is used by the
prysm REST mode validator (a feature which requires the validator to be configured to use the beacon
api intead of prysm's stock grpc endpoints) or accessory software that connects to the events api,
like https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter

### Fixed 

- Recover from panics when writing the event stream [#14545](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14545)

## [v5.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1) - 2024-10-15

This release has a number of features and improvements. Most notably, the feature flag 
`--enable-experimental-state` has been flipped to "opt out" via `--disable-experimental-state`. 
The experimental state management design has shown significant improvements in memory usage at
runtime. Updates to libp2p's gossipsub have some bandwidith stability improvements with support for
IDONTWANT control messages. 

The gRPC gateway has been deprecated from Prysm in this release. If you need JSON data, consider the
standardized beacon-APIs. 

Updating to this release is recommended at your convenience.

⚠️ Deprecation Notice: Removal of gRPC Gateway and Gateway Flag Renaming ⚠️

In an upcoming release, we will be deprecating the gRPC gateway and renaming several associated flags. This change will
result in the removal of access to several internal APIs via REST, though the gRPC endpoints will remain unaffected. We
strongly encourage systems to transition to using the beacon API endpoints moving forward. Please refer to PR for more
details.

- Add GetIndividualVotes endpoint
- Implement is_better_update for light client
