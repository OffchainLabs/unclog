## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.2...v5.1.3) - 2024-12-04

This is a hotfix release with one change.

Prysm v5.1.1 contains an updated implementation of the beacon api streaming events endpoint. This
new implementation contains a bug that can cause a panic in certain conditions. The issue is
difficult to reproduce reliably and we are still trying to determine the root cause, but in the
meantime we are issuing a patch that recovers from the panic to prevent the node from crashing.

This only impacts the v5.1.1 release beacon api event stream endpoints. This endpoint is used by the
prysm REST mode validator (a feature which requires the validator to be configured to use the beacon
api intead of prysm's stock grpc endpoints) or accessory software that connects to the events api,
like https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter
